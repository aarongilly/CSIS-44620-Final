# Web Mining and Applied NLP (44-620) Final

## Web Scraping and NLP with Requests, BeautifulSoup, and spaCy

### Student Name: Aaron Gillespie

For this final, I am to demonstrate capabilities & proficiencies in web scraping and natrual language processing using Python. I will be scraping data from the web, saving it locally, running a sentiment analysis and generating a summary of an article from the web. The assignment is open-ended, and thus **I've chosen to continue with what's become my signature move/tradition & pointing my newfound coding capabilities toward one of my giant long-running projects to see what I can learn about myself**. In particular, I'll be analyzing (at least) one of my entries from [my personal blog](https://aarongilly.com/Columns).
